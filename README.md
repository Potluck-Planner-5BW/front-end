‚òùÔ∏è Proposal

What problem does your app solve?

Organizing a potluck can be really messy. Our app makes it easier for potluck groups to have clear communication and expectations about their gatherings.

Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

-Solves the problem of having too many of one food and not enough of another
-Guests can self-assign what they want to bring from a list so they are not stuck with something they don't want to bring
-Information about the potluck is all in one place
-Only the organizer can change information about the event so that it stays consistent and accurate

What is the mission statement?

Takes the guesswork out of planning and organizing a potluck!

üí° Features

What features are required for your minimum viable product?
Register page.
Login page.
Organizer page
--create a list of all the food items that are needed
--edit location, date, time
Guest page
--confirmation if they are coming
--if coming, the list of available items will appear as radio
--when guest click on an item and submit, it will be crossed off so others cannot choose it

What features may you wish to put in a future release?
-Automated food list when selecting a type of food. Easier for organizer. It will generate a list of what food is needed so they don't have to manually add the food items.
-Quantity of food split between people. Example: We need 50 wings. One person only wants to bring 25. It will not be crossed off, and then number will change from 50 to 25.
